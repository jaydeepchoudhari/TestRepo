Hi, I hope you are doing well. I have only a day's membership left to send chats on this app, so sharing few details. In case you're interested, feel free to contact me. I currently live in Nala Sopara. It's my native place & I live with my family. I'm flexible on locations if housing responsibilities can be shared. We can discuss if you'd like to. In the interest of both of our times, I should be upfront about one more thing, I've had hair fall issues for a few years now and I currently manage it with a hair patch. I understand if any of this is a factor for you. If not, I am sharing my contacts, I'd love to chat more. Let me know instagram: jaydeepchoudhari whatsapp: 9096470734
