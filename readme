Title:
What is the Fastest and Most Efficient Way to Create a Copy of a Large Oracle Table with 250 Million Rows?

Body:

I have an Oracle table with 250 million rows, and I need to create a quick copy of this table. I'm looking for the fastest and most efficient method to do this while minimizing downtime and resource consumption.

Here are the constraints and considerations:

The table has indexes, constraints, and triggers that I might need to retain or rebuild.
I want a method that can scale properly, given the table's size.
I would prefer if the solution could make use of parallel processing or other optimizations to speed up the process.
What methods are available in Oracle for copying such a large table quickly?

Should I use CREATE TABLE AS SELECT, INSERT INTO ... SELECT, or a different approach?
How can I enable parallel processing to handle the large dataset efficiently?
Would using Oracle Data Pump be a better alternative for this use case?
Any guidance, best practices, or advice on the most effective approach would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you in advance!
